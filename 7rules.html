            <li><strong>Here are some rules to follow when creating a strong password:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Use at least 10 characters, but 12 or more is better.</li>
                <li>Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can also include nonsensical character arrangements. Avoid using guessable character substitutions or keyboard paths, like < or >.</li>
                <li>Don't use your name, birthdate, or other personal information. You can also avoid using words that are in the dictionary, or names of people, characters, products, or organizations</li>
                <li>Create a unique password for each account, device, application, website, and software. If a cyber criminal guesses one of your passwords, they can use it to try to hack into all of your accounts.</li>
                <li>You can use phrases that you can twist, like song lyrics with numbers and symbols.</li>
