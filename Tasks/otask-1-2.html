        <legend>Pav Bhaji</legend>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Pav Bhaji is popular Indian street food originating from Mumbai.It has spicy mashed vegetables served with dinner rolls. Pav refers to the bread and bhaji means vegetables.A special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala is used to flavor the dish, which is finished with lots of butter and cilantro!</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;It came into existence in 1800s when cotton mill workers in the city had to work for long hours and would often miss their meals and remain hungry. So pav bhaji was that easy quick meal which was invented to feed these workers during those times.There are different types of pav bhaji depending on how it’s made. There’s Jain version which is minus the onion and garlic. Then there’s Kathiyawadi Pav Bhaji which uses some local spices and is popular in the Kathiawar region in Gujarat. There’s also Khada Pav bhaji where vegetables are not mashed (khada=straight).</p>

            <summary>Ingredients to make Pav Bhaji .</summary>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;There are 2 parts to this recipe – the pav and the bhaji.</p>
            <ul>
                <p>&emsp;<strong>Ingredients for The Bhaji</strong> (other than basic staples like onion, tomato, ginger, garlic & green chili) :</p>
                <br>
                <center><img  class="sss" src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pav-Bhaji-Ingredients-1014x1536.jpg" alt="" height="350" width="250"></center>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> bhaji is made with mixed vegetables and the most commonly used vegetables in pav bhaji are potatoes, cauliflower, green pepper, peas. Carrots, beets, beans are also commonly used.</li>
                <li><strong>Pav bhaji masala:</strong> the main flavor in the bhaji comes from a special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala. You can either get it from Indian grocery store (I like Everest) or make it at home (see recipe below).</li>
                <li><strong>Kashmiri red chili powder:</strong> this is added mainly for color. Do not confuse it with regular chili powder, this one isn’t hot.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong> there’s no good pav bhaji without lots of butter! I love using amul butter in my pav bhaji.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomato puree:</strong> along with fresh tomatoes, I also like adding some store bought tomato puree for extra flavor. I would highly recommend not skipping it.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> to finish the pav bhaji, you would need a good squeeze of lemon juice and lots of cilantro.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;is basically eggless dinner rolls. You can find them at Indian grocery stores or you can also make them at home following the recipe for homemade pav. If  you can’t find pav and don’t want to make them at home either, here are your options:</p>
                <br>
                <li>Regular burger buns</li>
                <li>Dinner rolls</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</li>
            <li> Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again, I used my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
            <p>Cook the ginger-garlic-green chili for 1 minute.</p>
            <img class="imgg" src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pav-Bhaji-Recipe-Image-Step-1.jpg" alt="Process" width="50%" >
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).</li>
            <li>Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</li>
            <img src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pav-Bhaji-Recipe-Image-2.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
            <li>Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 3/4 – 1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such.</li>
            <p>Cover the pot and set heat to low. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.</p>
            <li>Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
            <img src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pav-Bhaji-Recipe-Image-3.jpg" alt="" width="50%">
            <li>Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.</li>
            <li>To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan.</li>
            <li>Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.</li>

          <summary>Serving Suggestions .</summary>
          <fieldset>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;To serve the pav bhaji, place ladle full of bhaji in a plate. Top the bhaji with a dollop of Amul butter. Serve with 2 pavs and a side of chopped onions and a lemon wedge. I like to serve with lots of onions on the sides, it tastes really amazing that way!</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;If you are planning to serve other things alongside pav bhaji, I would recommend Tawa Pulao, Paneer Tikka, Cucumber Raita. These all will be great additions.</p>
